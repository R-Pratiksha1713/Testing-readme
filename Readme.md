| R.PRATIKSHA          |Went through the libraray functions in Java for code simplification.Finding and implementation of logic|
| SINDU.A.S            |Various approaches were suggested towards solving the problem.Tried implementation of code in C|

#### 3.INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
* On the terminal:
###### Complile as:
javac Asn03G08P06.java
###### Run as:
java Asn03G08P06
* Answer to the question un the format Yes or No.

#### 4.DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT:
Example:
###### Input:
Answer the following questions as Yes or No
Is the sum 5 or 9 or 12 or 13 or 15 or 16?
Yes
Is the sum 13 or 12 or 9?
No
Is the sum 15?
No
Is the sum 16?
Yes
###### Output:
Sum=16


#### 5.CHALLENGES FACED AND HOW DID YOU ADDRESS THESE:
* As the code in C would be lenghty and quite difficult to implement,we tried to implement in code in Java.
* Since Java already has built-in functions it was a tough task in chosing the right one.
* Since we are in the basic level of Java programming learning and implemnting new stuff was quite challenging.

#### 6.WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT:
* Traversing of a tree in Java was learnt.
In C the operator '->' was used to traverse a tree.In case of Java '.' operator worked well.
* Learnt few of the library functions in Java.
* Solving the peoblem of Nested-if was learnt.
* After completion of code it was quite difficult to find out the exact place were we had gone wrong,so the Dangling else problem was leanrt to be solved.
