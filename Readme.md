#Assignment 03

##1.TEAM DEATILS:
    
    NAME                      USN
*1.R.PRATIKSHA               1KS18CS076
*2.SINDU.A.S                 1KS18CS096
*3.VARIDHI MADHURANATH       1KS18CS111

##2.CONTRIBUTION OF EACH TEAM MEMBER:

*a)R.PRATIKSHA:
Went through the libraray functions in Java for code simplification.Finding and implementation of logic. 

*b)SINDU.A.S:
Various approaches were suggested towards solving the problem.Tried implementation of code in C.

*c)VARIDHI MADHURANATH:
Error correction.

##3.INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
*a)On the terminal:
####Complile as:
javac Asn03G08P06.java
####Run as:
java Asn03G08P06
*b)Answer to the question un the format Yes or No.

##4.DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT:
Example:
####Input:
Answer the following questions as Yes or No
Is the sum 5 or 9 or 12 or 13 or 15 or 16?
Yes
Is the sum 13 or 12 or 9?
No
Is the sum 15?
No
Is the sum 16?
Yes
####Output:
Sum=16


##5.CHALLENGES FACED AND HOW DID YOU ADDRESS THESE:
*a)As the code in C would be lenghty and quite difficult to implement,we tried to implement in code in Java.
*b)Since Java already has built-in functions it was a tough task in chosing the right one.
*c)Since we are in the basic level of Java programming learning and implemnting new stuff was quite challenging.

6.WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT:
*a)Traversing of a tree in Java was learnt.
In C the operator '->' was used to traverse a tree.In case of Java '.' operator worked well.
*b)Learnt few of the library functions in Java.
*c)Solving the peoblem of Nested-if was learnt.
*d)After completion of code it was quite difficult to find out the exact place were we had gone wrong,so the Dangling else problem was leanrt to be solved.
